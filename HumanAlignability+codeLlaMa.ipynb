    "## Manual Pipeline - human aligned LlaMa 2 -> Generates input for Code LlaMa\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Human Alignability is a major concern in the era of LLMs, and as LLMs grow, a main concern revolves around how LLMs can scale to a point where they can be chained together. LlaMa 2 is a popular LLM that can pair with Mini LM (Embedding Model) that can help us with using retrieval augmented generation and then we are going to have our embeddings be created on two main documents:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A document focusing on the legal rules regarding Human Alignability of LLMs\n",
    "2. A document called \"Evaluation of LLMs trained on code\" that was used to train PaLM2 (Google)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we will use this trained model (LlaMa 2) to give input into the Code Llama, and see how it functions. We will then talk about the use of human alignability and RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback) with a reward model in place. Let's get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### STEPS:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Deploy LlaMa 2 and Mini LM for embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create chunks of documents for our LLM (In this case, LlaMa 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use RAG and Langchain to get responses and use the responses to feed into Code LlaMa\n",

       "' Large language models that can generate code, such as transformer-based models like BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet, have shown remarkable capabilities in a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, like any other AI technology, they also come with certain risks and challenges. Here are some of the potential risks associated with large language models that code:\\n\\n1. Security vulnerabilities: Large language models can generate code that is syntactically correct but semantically flawed, leading to security vulnerabilities in software systems. For example, a model that generates code with SQL injection attacks or cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities can compromise sensitive data or steal sensitive information.\\n2. Unintended consequences: Large language models can generate code that is difficult to understand or interpret, leading to unintended consequences. For example, a model that generates code with complex logic or unexpected edge cases can cause unexpected behavior in software systems, leading to errors or crashes.\\n3. Lack of domain knowledge: Large language models may not have the same level of domain-specific knowledge as human developers, leading to code that is not optimized for a particular domain or use case. This can result in code that is less efficient, less scalable, or less maintainable than code written by human developers.\\n4. Ethical concerns: Large language models can generate code that raises ethical concerns, such as code that promotes hate speech or discrimination. This can be a problem if the model is trained on biased data or if it is used to generate code that is harmful or offensive.\\n5. Intellectual property theft: Large language models can generate code that is similar to existing code, leading to intellectual property theft or plagiarism. This can be a problem if the model is trained on proprietary code or if it generates code that is too similar to existing code.\\n6. Dependence on data quality: Large language models are only as good as the data they are trained on. If the training data is of poor quality, the model may generate code that is inaccurate, incomplete, or biased. This can lead to software systems that are less reliable or less effective than they could be.\\n7. Lack of accountability: Large language models can generate code that is difficult to trace or attribute to a particular developer, leading to a lack of accountability in software development. This can make it difficult to identify and fix errors or bugs in software systems.\\n8. Uncontrolled proliferation: Large language models can generate code at an uncontrolled rate, leading to a proliferation of code that is difficult to manage or maintain. This can lead to software systems that are less efficient, less scalable, or less maintainable than they could be.\\n9. Lack of transparency: Large language models can generate code that is difficult to interpret or understand, leading to a lack of transparency in software development. This can make it difficult to identify and fix errors or bugs in software systems.\\n10. Dependence on model updates: Large language models are constantly evolving, and their performance can degrade over time if they are not updated regularly. This can lead to software systems that are less effective or less efficient than they could be.\\n\\nTo mitigate these risks, it is important to carefully evaluate and test large language models before using them for code generation. This can involve testing the model on a variety of tasks and evaluating its performance on different datasets. Additionally, it is important to ensure that the model is trained on diverse and representative data, and that it is regularly updated and improved to maintain its performance.'"

       "\" Evaluating models that code, also known as machine learning models that generate code, can be challenging due to the complexity of the code and the lack of standardized evaluation metrics. However, there are several approaches that can be used to evaluate the quality and effectiveness of these models:\\n\\n1. Code coverage: Measure the percentage of the codebase that is covered by the generated code. This can help identify areas where the model is not generating enough code or is generating duplicate code.\\n2. Code quality metrics: Use metrics such as cyclomatic complexity, Halstead complexity, and maintainability index to evaluate the quality of the generated code. These metrics can help identify code that is difficult to understand, maintain, or debug.\\n3. Testing: Test the generated code thoroughly to identify any bugs or errors. This can be done using automated testing tools or manual testing.\\n4. Code review: Have human developers review the generated code to identify any issues or areas for improvement. This can help ensure that the code is readable, maintainable, and follows best practices.\\n5. Performance evaluation: Measure the performance of the generated code using metrics such as execution time, memory usage, and scalability. This can help identify any performance bottlenecks or issues.\\n6. Comparison to hand-written code: Compare the generated code to equivalent hand-written code to evaluate its quality and effectiveness. This can help identify areas where the model is not generating as good code as a human developer.\\n7. User feedback: Collect feedback from users of the generated code to identify any issues or areas for improvement. This can help ensure that the code is meeting the needs of its users.\\n8. Code generation metrics: Use metrics such as the number of lines of code generated, the number of functions generated, and the number of classes generated to evaluate the productivity and efficiency of the model.\\n9. Code transformation metrics: Use metrics such as the number of transformations applied, the number of lines of code transformed, and the number of classes transformed to evaluate the effectiveness of the model in transforming the input code.\\n10. Hybrid evaluation: Use a combination of the above metrics to evaluate the model. For example, you could use a combination of code coverage, code quality metrics, and user feedback to get a comprehensive view of the model's performance.\\n\\nIt's important to note that evaluating models that code is a complex task and requires a combination of automated and manual evaluation methods. Additionally, the evaluation metrics used will depend on the specific use case and the goals of the model.\""

      "\n",
      "Result:  Based on the context provided, functional correctness in models that write code refers to the ability of the model to generate code that is not only syntactically correct but also semantically accurate and functional as intended by the user. In other words, functional correctness measures how well the generated code meets the user's expectations and fulfills their intentions, rather than just matching a reference solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "The authors argue that functional correctness is a more important metric than traditional match-based metrics, such as BLEU score, because it better captures the capabilities of the model and its alignment with the user's intentions. They also mention that in practice, human developers use functional correctness to judge code, and that a framework called test-driven development dictates that software requirements be converted into test cases before any implementation begins, with success defined by a program that passes these tests.\n",
